    <h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The purpose of this blog post is to explore the possibility of applying linear regression to 
describe, analyze and predict
the listing price of used cars. In this regard, linear regression is introduced more loosely 
without having to define concepts in a strict mathematical sense. The data used in this post
is scrapped from major used car listing websites. For more on the data and the subsequent
analysis see <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mEyob/linear-regression-car-price/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">this</a> Jupyter Notebook or see the ‘Data’ section below. A serverless API of the final model is available <a href="https://js68st2ska.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev">here</a>.
You can also checkout my <a href="https://github.com/mEyob/linear-regression-car-price">Github</a> page if 
you are interested in the python code used for scrapping or if you want to download the data in csv format.</p>

<p>To make like-for-like comparisons and analysis, the following mid-sized sedans are considered.</p>

<table style="width:50%">
<tr>
    <th>Manufacturer</th>
    <th>Model</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Toyota</td>
    <td>Camry</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Honda</td>
    <td>Accord</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nissan</td>
    <td>Altima</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Ford</td>
    <td>Fusion</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Hyundai</td>
    <td>Sonata</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Chevrolet</td>
    <td>Malibu</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Volkswagen</td>
    <td>Passat</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>The goal is to be able to address questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much would a model X car that is driven Y miles cost?</li>
  <li>What is the average price of model X cars after Y miles of usage?</li>
  <li>How much does depriciation (w.r.t. mileage, release year) affect model A cars compared to model B?</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, everything stated in this blog post is solely based on curiosity and the desire
to apply regression to the used car market. Obviously, anyone seriously considering to buy a car
should seek expert advice.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-theory">2. The theory</h3>

<p>Linear regression inherently assumes that there is a linear relationship between a 
random variable (the dependent variable) and another set of random variable(s)
(the independent variables), i.e,</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">Y = a_0 + a_1X_1 + ...+ a_dX_d + e</script>,</p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">a_0</script> is called the intercept and <script type="math/tex">a_i</script> is the coefficient for <script type="math/tex">X_i</script>.
Often, the independent variable and the coefficients are expressed as <script type="math/tex">d+1</script>-dimensional
vectors, i.e., <script type="math/tex">X=[1 X_1 X_2 ... X_d]</script> and <script type="math/tex">A=[a_0 a_1 ... a_d]</script></p>

<p>Linear regression acknowledges the relationship between the dependent and independent 
random variables can be non-deterministic. That is, there can be some uncertainity 
involved in determining the value of Y evenif we have a perfect knowledge of the values 
of the <script type="math/tex">X_i</script>s. This uncertainity is represented by the error term e in the regression 
equation. All the uncertainity we cannot (or don’t want to) explain about Y is absorbed 
by this term.</p>

<p>In order to build reliable models we make the following assumptions on the error term:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The error <script type="math/tex">e</script> should be independent of <script type="math/tex">X</script>. For example,
let our linear regression model represent the power consumption of an electronic device 
as a function of the load, and let us assume the model is <script type="math/tex">P = P_0 + a L + e</script>
(<script type="math/tex">P</script> and <script type="math/tex">L</script> representing the <script type="math/tex">Power</script> and <script type="math/tex">Load</script> random variables, respectively).
The independence assumption dictates that the probabilistic nature of <script type="math/tex">e</script> should remain 
unaffected whether the load is <em>10%, 95%</em>, or any other value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spread of e remains constant across all values of X. Going back to the previous example,
e should not be more (or less) spread for the range of load values under study.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If statistical tests are required, we further need to assume that e has a normal
distribution centered at 0. For further details on related matter check the <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/ols-linear-regression-assumptions/">assumptions</a> 
and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-do-you-check-the-quality-of-your-regression-model-in-python-fa61759ff685">best practices</a> 
of linear regression.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The coefficients in a linear regression model can be solved directly by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares"><em>matrix inversion</em></a> or more iteratively 
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent"><em>gradient descent</em></a> or one of its variants.</p>

<p>Here it is important to note that the ‘linear’ in linear regression does not necessarily 
mean the relationship between X and Y is expressed as a straight line. For example,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y = a_0 + a_1(X_1)^2 + a_2Log(X_2)</script>

<p>is also considered a linear model as long as the expression remains linear in the 
coefficients.</p>

<p>Clearly, there is a plethora of models to choose from. 
we, therefore, need to have metrics that quantify how well a model performs in capturing 
the relationship between X &amp; Y to be able to select the best model. Two of such metrics are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong>: Also refered to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">coefficient of determination</a>
indicates how much of the variability of Y is explained by X (the independent variable). R<sup>2</sup> of 
1 tells us X perfectly (100%) explains the variability in Y, i.e., there is no uncertainty left in Y once 
the values of X are known. By contrast, R<sup>2</sup> of 0 suggests X does not explain any of 
the variability in Y at all. Other values between 0 and 1 lie on the spectrum accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Predicted <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> and Adjusted <em>R<sup>2</sup></em></strong>: One weakness of <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> is that it is susiptible to 
overfitting. Predicted <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> and Adjusted <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> are aimed at mitigating this issue. Read
<a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interpret-adjusted-r-squared-predicted-r-squared-regression/">this</a>
post for more detail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RMSE</strong>: The <em>Root Mean Squared Error</em> is  the expected magnitude of prediction error. 
RMSE = 0 represents a perfect model, and model performance decreases as RMSE increases. 
RMSE can also be nicely decomposed into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrEyxfl2-a8">bias and variance</a> terms of the model.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will also apply <em>confidence</em> and <em>prediction</em> intervals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNIpR8bdgUo">This</a> video
elegantly shows what their difference is and how to calculate them.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-data">3. The data</h3>

<p>The data, as already mentioned in the introduction, is scrapped from car listing websites.
The scrapped data is parsed and cleaned and the resulting data is stored in a csv file, which
has the following format:</p>

<table style="width:75%">
<tr>
    <th>Year</th>
    <td>Year of release, e.g. 2010, 2019</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Make</th>
    <td>Manufacturer of the car: Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Ford, Hyundai, Chevrolet and Volkswagen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Model</th>
    <td>Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion, Sonata, Malibu or Passat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Model detail</th>
    <td>Trim level, e.g. for Honda LX, Sport, EX, EX-L and Touring</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Price</th>
    <td>Listing price of the car</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Mileage</th>
    <td>Mileage (in miles) posted by dealer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>Website</th>
    <td>A two letter abbreviation to identify the source website</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The following table provides valuable summary statistics of the quantitative columns</p>

<center><img src="/assets/img/cars-summary-stat.png" align="middle" style="width: 300px; height: 400px" /></center>

<p>The CSV file contains listing details of 11,018 cars. However, dealers may list the same 
car more than once to improve its chance of being discovered among other cars. Duplicate entries 
may lead to inaccurate analysis and prediction. We, therefore, need to remove duplicates and run
the summary statistics again. Doing so reveals that about half of the listings are duplicate entries
as shown below.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/img/cars-summary-stat-nodup.png" align="middle" style="width: 300px; height: 400px" /></center>

<p>Now we know that there are 6396 unique cars. Going one level deeper, we can see the number of cars, 
the average price, average mileage and average release year per manufacturer (model) below</p>

<center><img src="/assets/img/per-manufac-stat.png" align="middle" style="width: 400px; height: 500px" /></center>

<p>Out of the 6396 unique cars listed, 1540 are Nissan Altima, 1317 are Toyota Camry, 1058 are Honda Accord
and so on.</p>

<h3 id="4-analysis">4. Analysis</h3>

<p>Here, the goal is to build a multi-linear regression model that predicts (summarizes) the 
<em>Listing Price</em> of a used mid-size sedan car based on its <em>Mileage</em>, <em>Release (Model) Year</em>, and <em>Trim level</em>.
We’ll build separate regression models for each of the cars listed above, excluding VW Passat 
and Chevrolet Malibu.</p>

<p>Before jumping into building the regression models, let us examine how <em>Price</em> tends to change 
with respect to <em>Mileage</em> and <em>Year</em> by taking the Honda Accord data set as an example. The following plots reveal 
the strong negative relationship between mileage and price and the strong positive relationship between release year and price.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/img/honda-trend-curves.png" align="middle" style="width: 800px; height: 500px" /></center>

<p>The correlation matrix shown below quantifies this relationship. It also shows the strong negative relationship 
between Mileage and Year. Intuitively, it is highly unlikely for a 2019 model to rack up 100,000 miles
as it is equally unlikely for a 2008 model to have a mileage of 10,000 miles.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/img/honda-corr.png" align="middle" style="width: 300px; height: 250px" /></center>

<p>For more on this and other analysis related to regression model building see <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mEyob/linear-regression-car-price/blob/master/analysis.ipynb">this</a> python notebook.</p>

<h4 id="41-regression-models">4.1 Regression models</h4>
<p>After considering a number of features and feature transforms the following regression function that better expresses the relationship between the independent variables (<em>Mileage</em>, <em>Year</em>, <em>Trim level</em>)and dependent variable (<em>Listing Price</em>)is  chosen:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">P_i(M_i, Y_i, T_i) = a_0 + a_1 log2(M_i) + a_2 (2019 - Y_i) + \sum_{j=2}^{n} a_{j+1} 1_{\{T_j=T_i\}}</script>,</p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">P_i,M_i, Y_i, \text{ and }T_i</script> are the <em>Price, Mileage, Year,</em> and <em>Trim</em> of car <script type="math/tex">i</script>, respectively.
<script type="math/tex">a_0, a_1, a_2</script> are the intercept, coefficient w.r.t <em>Mileage</em>, and coefficient w.r.t. <em>Year</em>.
Since trim level is a categorical variable, we need to <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)">dummy-encode</a> it before it can be used in a regression model. Assuming there are <script type="math/tex">n</script> trim levels of a car model <script type="math/tex">n-1</script> dummy variables are 
created using the summation of the indicators in the last term of the above equation. 
This results in one dummy variable for each trim level except the base trim-level. Coefficeint <script type="math/tex">a_{j+1}</script>,
therefore, represents the price difference between the base trim level and the <script type="math/tex">j^{th}</script> trim level.</p>

<p>Note that <em>Mileage</em> and <em>Year</em> are transformed using functions <script type="math/tex">f(M)=log2(M)</script> and <script type="math/tex">g(Y) = 2019 - Y</script>.
The log transformation of Mileage not only yields better model performance it can also be motivated by the 
fact that the sharpest decline in Price happens during the first few (thousand) miles. Once a car makes it
into tens of thousands of miles, the rate at which the Price decreases should slow down. Logarithmic 
functions are one of several functions that could capture this nonlinear relationship between <em>Mileage</em> and <em>Price</em>.
Since base 2 logarithm is used, $a_1$ represents the <em>depreciation with respect to mileage</em> every time mileage doubles.</p>

<p>When it comes to the <em>Year</em>, what affects the <em>Price</em> of a car is how old the model is relative to 
the newest model, which is why the transformation <script type="math/tex">g(Y) = 2019 - Y</script> is used. For example, a <script type="math/tex">2016</script>
Toyota Camry is <script type="math/tex">3</script> years old and should have a lower price than a <script type="math/tex">2017</script> (<script type="math/tex">2</script> years old) Toyota
Camry if everything else is kept constant.</p>

<p>Five elastic net regularised models are trained for Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Nissan Altima,
and Toyota Camry. The coefficients and performance metrics of the resulting models are shown below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">R^2</script> score is calculated on a test set after outlier removal using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%27s_distance">Cook’s distance</a>.
The number of cars used to train each model after outlier removal is presented in the ‘Count’ column.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the regression models, Toyota Camry has the smallest (in magnitude) coefficient w.r.t
<em>Mileage</em> at <script type="math/tex">a_1=-770</script>. Take, for example, the price of a given Toyota Camry is <script type="math/tex">\$20,000</script> at 500 miles. 
The model predicts that the average price drop is $19,230$ at 1000 miles,  $18,460 at 2000 miles, so on.</p>

<p>Note that coefficient <script type="math/tex">a_1</script> represents the <em>depreciation with respect to mileage</em>, which makes Toyota Camry 
the best one among the five models considered for retaining much of its original value as mileage increases.
By contrast, Nissan Altima and Hyundai Sonata exhibit the least <em>depreciation with respect to Year</em>, with every 
passing year reducing the value of the car by about $800.</p>

<p>The following plots show the fitted regression models for all car models along with the data used to fit 
the regression models. In order to simplify the plots into 2D, cars (points in the scatter plot) are 
assumed to rack up <a href="https://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/average-miles-driven-per-year-by-state.aspx">12000 miles per year</a>, allowing us to represent <em>Year</em> in terms of <em>Mileage</em> as <script type="math/tex">Year = Mileage // 12000</script>.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/img/regfit-all.png" align="middle" style="width: 500px; height: 600px" /></center>

<p>The bottom right plot shows all five regression curves in one plot. This plot, once more, gives the visual
confirmation that Toyota Camry loses the least amount of value to depreciation.</p>

<p>Without the 12000 miles/year assumption, the resulting plots are 3-dimensional. The next figure 
shows such a plot for Honda Accord. It is easy to see that <em>Price</em> decreases linearly in the <em>Year</em>
axis and logarithmically in the <em>Mileage</em> axis.</p>

<h4 id="42-prediction-and-comparison">4.2 Prediction and comparison</h4>

<p>The regression models we built can be used to predict the value of a car as well as making inference.
Typcial questions we are interested in prediction are “What is the average price 
of used cars from model X, Year Y, trim T with mileage M?” or “What is the price range for a particular
used car from model X, Year Y, trim T with mileage M?”. The former question is answered using the 
the regression line and calculating a <em>confidence interval</em> around it, while the latter is addressed by 
calculating a <em>prediction interval</em> along the regression line.</p>

<p>For example, the predicted average price of the base trim-level (LE) 2016 Toyota Camry cars at 40000 miles is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(40000, 2016, T_1) = 30392 -770 \log_{2}(40000) -1010 (2019 - 2016) + 0 = 15590</script>

<p>with a narrow 95% confidence interval of <script type="math/tex">[15490, 15690]</script> while the 95% prediction interval is 
<script type="math/tex">[11990, 19190]</script>. Roughly speaking, this means there is a 95% chance that a 2016 Toyota Camry LE car
will have a listing price between <script type="math/tex">\$12,000</script> and <script type="math/tex">\$19,000</script> at <script type="math/tex">40000</script> miles.</p>

<p>If we compare these numbers to a 2016 Hyundai Sonata car at 40000 miles, we get</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(40000, 2016, T_1) = 34093 -1200 \log_{2}(40000) -770 (2019 - 2016) + 0 = 13438</script>

<p>with confidence and prediction intervals of <script type="math/tex">[13318, 13558]</script> and <script type="math/tex">[10038, 16838]</script>, respectively.</p>

<p>In some cases, the prediction intervals can be too wide to be useful, specially compared 
to the narrow confidence intervals for the average listing price. However, considering 
the long list of factors that can affect the price of a car, this should not be surprising 
since the regression model only uses mileage, year, and trim level to predict price. The 
intervals could be narrowed down by obtaining more data and including additional features
such as engine type, repair history and accident history.</p>

<h3 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h3>

<p>This post illustrated how a simple approach such as linear regression can be applied 
to infere and predict the listing price of used mid-sized sedans. While regression can be 
a valuable tool to predict a continuous valued dependent variable, it also sets some assumptions
about the predicted and predicting variables that need to be checked before the resulting 
regression model can be deemed acceptable.</p>

<p>Once the assumptions are checked, regression models can easily be trained with a relatively
small amount of data, and in addtion to it’s predictive power, the coefficients of the model also
give some insight on the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the dependent and 
independent variables.</p>
