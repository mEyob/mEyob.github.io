Thanks for visiting my site. I do research in performance analysis and cost optimization of 
distributed computing systems and cloud architectures. I utilize 
a range of theoretical and practical analysis methods such as 
statistical analysis of server logs, queueing theory, stochastic modeling,
and event-driven simulations in my research. While you are here, please vist 
my [blog posts](/blog), [publications](/publications) and [projects](projects).
