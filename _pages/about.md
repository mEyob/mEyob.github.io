I am a doctoral candidate in [Aalto University Department of Communications 
and Networking](http://comnet.aalto.fi/en/). I do research in performance analysis and cost optimization of 
distributed computing systems and cloud architectures. I utilize 
a range of theoretical and practical analysis methods such as 
statistical analysis of server logs, queueing theory, stochastic modeling,
and event-driven simulations in my research. See also 
my [blog posts](/blog), [publications](/publications) and [projects](projects)
for more detail.
