Welcome to my website. I am a doctoral student in performance analysis and optimization of distributed computing 
systems such as web server farms and scientific compute clusters. I mainly apply queueing theory, stochastic modeling,
data analysis, multi-objective optimization and event-driven simulations in my research. While you are here, please have a 
look at my publications and blog posts.
