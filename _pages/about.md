Welcome. I do research in performance analysis and cost optimization of distributed computing 
systems and cloud infrastructures. I utilize practical analysis methods such as 
statistical analysis of server logs, and theoretical analysis methods like queueing theory, stochastic modeling,
and event-driven simulations in my research. While you are here, please have a 
look at my publications and blog posts. Thanks!
